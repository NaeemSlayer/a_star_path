Project: A* Path Finding Visualizer:
As a student, I developed a path finding visualizer tool using Python, implementing the A* search algorithm. This project involved building an efficient algorithm for pathfinding, surpassing traditional methods like breadth-first search or depth-first search. The visualizer demonstrates the A* algorithm in action, providing an insightful understanding of informed search techniques.
